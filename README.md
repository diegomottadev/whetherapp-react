# Goal of the project

  This React project was not just about learning how to connect to an API and fetch data, it was also about creating a useful and practical application. By using the OpenWeatherMap API, we were able to obtain weather forecasts for different cities and display the information in a clear and visually appealing way.

# Technologies Used
## The application uses the following technologies:

  - React: The JavaScript framework for building the user interface.

  - Axios: A JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests.

  - OpenWeatherMap API: A public API provided by OpenWeatherMap for obtaining weather forecasts for cities.

  - Material-UI: A library of React components for creating fast and beautiful user interfaces.
